
Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is the maximum amount of time that your system can lose data for. 
RPO is not tied to whether your system is available, it is a measure of the window of time that you may lose data in.

Recover Time Objective (RTO) is the maximum time your platform or service can be unavailable. 
If your platform is offline from noon until 5:00pm and you have a 4 hour RTO, then you have failed to maintain your RTO.


Recover Time Objective (RTO)
****************************
Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage

Minimum RTO for a single region outage
	- around 5 minutes. The time taken to promote the standby read replica RDS database into a active one.

Recovery Point Objective (RPO)
******************************
Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
	- is 0. As the Failover & Recovery from active to standby is done without losing data.
Minimum RPO for a single region outage
	- is 0. The replica is done instaneously without losing any data.
