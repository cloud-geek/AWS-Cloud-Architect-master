AWS Foundational Security Best Practices v1.0.0


CRITICAL:

	1. S3 buckets should prohibit public write access

	2. S3 buckets should prohibit public read access

	3. RDS snapshot should be private
	
	4. IAM root user access key should not exist
	
	5. CodeBuild GitHub or Bitbucket source repository URLs should use OAuth
	
	6. CodeBuild project environment variables should not contain clear text credentials
	
	7. Hardware MFA should be enabled for the root user
	
	8. Lambda functions should prohibit public access by other accounts
	
	
HIGH:

	1. IAM policies should not allow full '*' administrative privileges

	2. CloudTrail should be enabled and configured with at least one multi-region trail


Analyse: 

Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.

1.) IAM policy is not following the principle of least privilege, allowing full access to resources.
2.) Loadbalancer is not configured to redirect Non-SSL(HTTP) requests to SSL(HTTPS)
3.) Application running on port 5000 can be easily accessible directly from public internet. 
4.) Serverside encryption and Logging is not enabled for S3 buckets
5.) IAM password policy - minimum length - Root account is not complaint 
6.) EC2 instance should be managed by AWS Systems Manager.


########################################################################
Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities:
########################################################################

IAM:
	- Adhere to the pre-defined Password policies.
	- Update the root account password
	- Modify the IAM to only read permission.

EC2 Intances:
	- Incoming traffic is allowed only directly from Security Groups.
	- Other common ports can be deleted and not defined access.
	- AWS Systems Manager can be used to manage access to the instances.

Storage:
	- Logging can be enabled to access the S3 Storage buckets.
