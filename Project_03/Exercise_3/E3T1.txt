# Describe GuardDuty findings that were detected related to the brute force attack

AWS GuardDuty can monitor CloudTrail, DNS, and VPC flow logs to identify suspicious activity. 
A few examples of activity that GuardDuty can identify:

		- SSH brute force attempts.
		- API calls from IP addresses that are on threat lists.
		- Traffic that is destined for crypto-currency related IPs from an EC2 instance.
		
	To detect the SSH brute attack, AWS GuardDuty will analyze the source & destination traffic data using the VPC Flow logs. 
	VPC Flow logs will have information on both the traffic going into and from the EC2 network interfaces.
